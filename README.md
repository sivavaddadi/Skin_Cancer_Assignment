## General Information
- This is assignment to evaluate learning about CNN
- This is a CNN based model to detect melanoma by evaluating images and predicting presence of melanoma.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Running model without data augmentation gives less than 50% accuracy score
- Post data augmentation the accuracy jumps to over 80%
